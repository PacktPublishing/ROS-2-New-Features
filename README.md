# ROS 2 New Features
This is the code repository for [ROS 2 New Features](https://www.packtpub.com/coding-and-tools/ros-2-new-features), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Robot Operating System 2 (or ROS 2) is designed to write applications which operate robotic hardware. ROS 2 is the network of nodes that allows communication/ information exchange between the components used in robots. The new features make ROS easier to learn and use.
In this course, you will be introduced to all the new features available in ROS 2. With simple and practical examples, we cover all of the new features introduced in ROS 2, especially major features including distributed discovery, node lifecycle management, security, and more. You will learn how to make the best use of these features and how they improve and secure the way you use ROS and support building real-time and modular systems.
By the end of the course, you will understand the new features introduced in ROS 2 and will be able to apply them to your systems.
